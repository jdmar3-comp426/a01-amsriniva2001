            <h1>Middle</h1>
            <p class = "text">Odysseus and his men were in a conundrum. They would have to escape Polyphemus's clutches without him noticing.
                But on the other hand, the cave's entrance was blocked by a huge rock that only Polyphemus had the strength to push.
            </p>
            <p class = "text"> Thus, Odysseus and his crew had to both make sure Polyphemus didn't see them, but also only escape during
                the rare times when the entrance was open. Thankfully, Odysseus had a plan.
            </p>

            <p class = "text">While Polyphemus was herding his sheep outside, Odysseus found a wooden staff and both hardened and heated it in a fire,
                making it a hard, red-hot weapon that would certainly leave a mark on anything it hit.
            </p>

            <p class = "text">That night, when Polyphemus came
                back, Odysseus made Polyphemus drink his ship's supply of wine, making him more approachable and dulling his senses. During their conversation,
            Polyphemus asked Odysseus's name. Odysseus told him that his name was "Nobody", something which Polyphemus believed.</p>
            
            <p class = "text">After a while, Polyphemus got so drunk that he collapsed. As Polyphemus lay out cold, Odysseus and some of his men drove the red-hot stick
                right into Polyphemus's eye! That would leave a mark!
