            <p class="text">Polyphemus woke up with a scream! He was now blinded but sensed Odysseus's deception. But he only knew him by the name
                he had told him, Nobody. When the other Cyclopes asked Polyphemus what was going on, he said that Nobody was trying to kill him.
                The Cyclopes believed this and did not investigate.

            <p class="text">The following day, Polyphemus still continued herding his sheep as usual, but now that he was blind, he didn't notice the crew sneaking out on
                the bellies of the sheep and make it back to the boat. As they were leaving the lands, Odysseus called out to Polyphemus and boasted of his victory,
                revealing his true name. In response, Polyphemus called out to his father Poseidon, god of the sea, and called for vengeance on Odysseus and his crew.
                These prayers were answered, as Odysseus and his men had to face many more obstacles and monsters on their way back home
