            <p>Having recently escaped the Land of the Lotus Eaters, Odysseus and his crew were still travelling through 
                mysterious lands on their way back home. 
            <p>During one stormy night, the crew arrived at the mysterious Land
               of the Cyclopes, a race of one-eyed giants. As they had done throughout their journey, the crew robbed and pillaged
               the livestock of the Cyclopes.</p>
            <p>Eventually, they came across an island with a large cave, inside which
               they found a flock of large sheep and crates of milk and cheese. An absolute feast! However, they were discovered
            by the cave's resident, the giant Cyclops Polyphemus! Although initially friendly, Polyphemus showed his
        monstrous side when he devoured several of Odysseus's men on the spot, and left the rest to eat later! What were they to do?</p>
